## Our goal
---

- Let's make an environmental quality monitoring station. 


## Required materials 
---

- 1 x [IOT:kit]()


## Background
---

### What is the environmental monitoring

- [Environmental monitoringn]()Environmental monitoring is to design environemntal monitoring and display & save the collected information by using of GIS. 


## Hardware connection
---

As below picture, let the light sensor be connected to `P1`. 

Let the BME280 module be connected to `SCL-P19` `SDA-P20` of the `IIC`.

Let the onboard RTC be connected to `IIC`.

Note：If you get a warning telling you some packages will be removed because of incompatibility issues, either follow the prompts or create a new project in the Project file menu.
### Step 2

Snap the `initialize OLED` in to the `on start`, initialize OLED screen pixels to `64*128`.

### Step 2

Snap the `show string` and `show number` blocks into the `forever` in turn.

Display current light intensity, humidity and temperature. 

Then, snap into the `insert newline`.
