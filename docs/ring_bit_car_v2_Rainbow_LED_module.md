### Software Programming
---

- Program a simple light-bar code in the [makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) .

 ![](https://i.imgur.com/zqBmuEN.png)

- Choose `NeoPixel at pin……` from the Neopixel brick to the "On Start" brick.
- Save the data collected by the 10pcs Rainbow LEDs connected to P2 port to `all_led` variable.

- Set the variable `Single` to the first LED from `choice` for all LEDs `all_led` in `forever` block.
- Add one for the variable `choice` in turns and choose the 10  LEDs in turns also.
