# Project 01: Music Machine

**Pin Layout**

- Buzzer: Pin0
- ADKeypad: Pin2

**Small note about the ADKeypad**


The ADKeypad returns an analog signal when its buttons are pressed. Each button pressed would return a unique integer value ranging from 0 (meaning 0V) to 1023 (meaning 3V). 
However, it is not uncommon that each button would give a small range of values when pressed at different times and different ADKeypads might give different signals yet again. Hence, in this example code, we provide a range of possible values that your ADKeypadâ€™s buttons are likely to return when pressed. 
Feel free to test out the values that your ADKeypad might return when pressed and change the values in the example code. ^ ^
