## Karel the LED

Help Karel make LED art!
Karel the LED can’t turn right, but he can make some great LED art!

The goal of this activity is to download the JavaScript code given below onto a micro:bit. Then use the program to introduce new students to the micro:bit. Students will not do the coding this time. They will be the users who get familiar with the board.

### How to play

- `A button`**Turn Left**

Does not draw anything just changes the direction Karel (the flashing led) is facing

- `B button`**Move Forward**

Moves Karel forward one step and leaves the LED on behind him

- `shake`**Jump**

Moves Karel forward one step without leaving the LED on behind him

- `A+B button`**Hide Karel**

Shows or hides Karel (the flashing LED), to be used once your artwork is complete

- `Reset button`**Clear the board and restart**

Restart the program and clear the board

**Note:** There is no way to erase, except by restarting.

### Try drawing some patterns

See if you can make each pattern below using **A**, **B**, and **shake**. Once you have completed a challenge press **A** and **B** at the same time to hide Karel. For patterns that you design, decide which LEDs you want to turn on and then make that design with Karel.

### First letter of your name

Figure out how to make the first letter of your name with the LEDs.

Thanks for playing with Karel the LED!

## Coding Karel the LED

Copy this code into the JavaScript editor and then download it to the board.
**Note:** For this project you need to manually copy the code and insert it into the JavaScript view of the editor.

    /**
     * Karel the LED
     */
    basic.forever(() => {
    if (board.isKarelActive) {
    led.toggle(board.karelX, board.karelY)
    basic.pause(500)
    }
    })
    input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, () => {
    board.pressedA();
    updateLeds();
    })
    input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, () => {
    board.pressedB();
    updateLeds();
    })
    input.onGesture(Gesture.Shake, () => {
    board.shake();
    updateLeds();
    })
    input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, () => {
    board.pressedAB();
    updateLeds();
    })
    function updateLeds() {
    for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
    for (let k = 0; k < 5; k++) {
